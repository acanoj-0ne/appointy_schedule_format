INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Move the files(Automated Schedule Format & data folder) into the XLSTART folder. (It can normally be found under ./Users/"My user"/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Excel (E.g. Local Disk (C:)/Users/johndoe/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Excel)

*Note AppData can be a hidden file. To see it on the file explorer window, click on View -> Show -> hidden items (Windows 11)

2. Open the new data folder and open the file Center Names.csv using the text editor of your choice, and replace the first two values with the center name from Appointy (E.g. Schaumburg, Schaumburg@Home, ... )

	2b. Optional: replace the last two entries with the names you'd like to print out (E. g. Schaumburg, Schaumburg@Home, At Center, Online)

3. In excel go to file -> options -> customize ribbon
	
	On the left hand side, choose commands from: Macros, and set it to the tab of your choice.
	
	If this is the first time that you customize the Ribbon, then Under the right list, select new tab, rename the new tab and new group to your choice, then click on AutomateScheduleFormat on the left side and click on add, you should now be able to access the function through your Ribbon.
